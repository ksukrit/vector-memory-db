# In-Memmory Vector Datastore

A simple in-memory datastore for storing vector embeddings

# Functionality 

- [x] Add Vectors
- [x] Subtract Vectors
- [x] Scale Vectors
- [x] Get Vectors
- [x] Delete Vectors
- [x] Dot Product
- [x] Change the embedding size (Default is currently 128)
- [x] Load vectors from a previously exited dump
- [x] Different size vectors (Pads the vectors to embedding size)
- [ ] ANN Search

# TODO

- [ ] Add proper documentation
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Approximate KNN Search
- [ ] Follow go based naming scheme for structs
- [ ] Follow go standards for organization
- [ ] Similarity between two vectors
- [ ] Custom map implementation
